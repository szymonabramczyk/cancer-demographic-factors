# Impact of Demographic Factors on Cancer Mortality Rates  

## Overview  
This project explores how demographic factors such as income, education level, and type of health insurance influence cancer mortality rates in the U.S. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression modeling to identify key predictors.  

## Repository Structure  
- **EDA-eng.ipynb** – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset.  
- **REG-eng.ipynb** – Regression modeling and results interpretation.
  **final_presentation.pdf** – Summary of the project, findings, and visualizations.  
- **avg-household-size.csv** – Data on average household size per region.  
- **cancer_reg.csv** – Main dataset with cancer incidence and mortality statistics.  
- **data.csv** – Processed dataset used in the analysis.  
- **cb_2018_us_state_500k/** – Shapefiles for geographic visualizations.  

## Key Findings  
- Higher income regions have lower cancer mortality rates.  
- Education level is negatively correlated with cancer mortality.  
- Type of health insurance significantly impacts survival rates.  

## Getting Started  
To explore the analysis, open and run the Jupyter notebooks (`EDA-eng.ipynb` and `REG-eng.ipynb`).
